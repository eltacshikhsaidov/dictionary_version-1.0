# dictionary_version-1.0
I'll show you one of my project's very very first code

This is very simple version of real dictionary and best practice for
learning basics of Python. I'll hope that it will be helpful for you
Note that this source code is about when you search some word
program automatically search its picture 
Let's look a little practice
When you want to learn some language the best learning way of course
the imagination of words in some language and remember them
According this assumption we can say that we enter for example 'apple'
and program automatically return it's picture just ve visualize it
